# ImageMaker Notes

## Be sure to read the assignment carefully
This document does not contain all the information needed to complete the project.

## Be sure the run configurations are correct
Refer to the guide on BlackBoard.  All configurations should use $PROJECT_DIR$
for the working directory.
The following executables should be setup using the "Catch" template:

- ImageMaker_Test
- Getter_Setter_Test
- Constructor_Test
- Save_Load_Test
- DrawPixel_Test
- DrawRectangle_Test
- DrawLine_Test

The following executables should be setup using the "CMake Application" template:

- ImageMaker_Demo


## my_tests.cpp
The executable My_Test is only used for your own tests.  It is not used for
grading.  It is up to you if you would like to use if for your own testing.

## ImageMaker_demo.cpp
This file does not require any additional code to be added for submission.
Use it purely as an example to see some example usage how ImageMaker class
is used. This file will NOT be used for grading.

You are welcome to change or add code and it for debugging.

## Grading Unit Tests
The unit_tests folder contains all the tests we will use for grading. 
These files are complete and do not require any additional code.
Your responsibility is to make sure that all the tests pass to receive
full marks for functionality (See assignment document for full details
on grading).

### The following are the files used for grading:

- constructor_tests.cpp
- save_load_tests.cpp
- getter_setter_tests.cpp
- DrawPixel_tests.cpp
- DrawRectangle_tests.cpp

> **WARNING:** *DO NOT CHANGE THESE TEST FILES*

If you want to make your own additional tests, you may make them in my_tests.cpp
or in the ImageMaker_demo.cpp file.

## images and test_images
These folders contain images used or generated by the unit tests.  The folder images holds 
images used by the unit tests (DO NOT CHANGE THESE!).  The folder test_images holds images
generated by the unit test (this folder will start empty).

> **WARNING:** *DO NOT CHANGE FILES IN THE "images" FOLDER*
